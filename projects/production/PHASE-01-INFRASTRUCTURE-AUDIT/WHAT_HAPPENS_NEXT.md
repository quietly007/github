# What Happens After Phase 01

## Agent completes work → sends you:
- AUDIT_REPORT.md with all findings

## Agent asks:
"Phase 01 complete. Audit report ready. Good? (Y/N)"

## If you answer Y:
1. Report is verified (I check it's complete)
2. Grade updated: 55/100 → 60/100
3. You send PHASE-02 folder to agent
4. Agent starts governance fixes

## If you answer N:
1. Agent fixes issues
2. Resubmits report
3. Asks again

## My Role (Verification Agent)

When you say "Y", I will:
- ✅ Check report has all required sections
- ✅ Verify container counts correct (25 Master, 36 Lady)
- ✅ Confirm top 10 errors documented
- ✅ Validate P0/P1/P2/P3 priorities assigned
- ✅ Confirm deliverable complete

If verification passes → Phase 01 closes → Phase 02 begins

**You approve. Agent works. I verify.**
