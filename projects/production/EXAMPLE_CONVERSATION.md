# EXAMPLE: How It Works

## Phase 01 Conversation

**You:** *Send PHASE-01 folder to agent*

**Agent:** "I received Phase 01: Infrastructure Audit. Should I begin? (Y/N)"

**You:** "Y"

**Agent:** "Starting audit now. Will take 4-6 hours..."

*...agent works...*

**Agent:** "Done! I created AUDIT_REPORT.md with:
- 25 Master containers listed
- 36 Lady containers listed  
- Container health status
- Top 10 errors found
- P0/P1/P2/P3 priorities

Should I proceed to Phase 02? (Y/N)"

**You:** "Y"

**Agent:** "Great! Please send me PHASE-02 folder."

---

## That's It!

You just answer **Y or N** twice per phase:
1. "Can I start?" → Y
2. "Work is done, good?" → Y

**Agent does everything else.**
