## Closure Gate (Mandatory)

Before Phase 00 finalization, user must choose one:

1. Accept UISP recurring `make: *** [Makefile:22: server_with_migrate] Error 1` as non-blocking advisory and close Phase 00.
2. Hold closure and require one more remediation loop to eliminate this log pattern.

Decision is recorded in `AGENT4/USER_VERIFICATION.md`.
