---

### IF YOU ARE AGENT #5: TODO Completion Specialist ⭐ CRITICAL

**Read:** [AGENT_5_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_5_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Your Mission:**
- **COMPLETE THE TODO LIST** - this is your ONLY job
- Expand 63 outlined items (TODO-013 to TODO-075) to full detail
- Every item needs: exact commands, expected outputs, success criteria, rollback plans
- Calculate A+++ grade trajectory (current 55/100 → target 98-100/100)
- Estimate: 7-10 hours of focused work
- Deliverable: COMPLETE_TODO_LIST_2026-02-10.md (80-100KB)
- Success: Agent #6 approves → execution begins
- Failure: Agent #6 rejects → you must revise

**Why You're Critical:**
- Four agents before you audited/verified but NONE completed the TODO list
- User demands: **"complete and detailed NO FAIL TODO list"**
- Without complete TODO: 10-30% chance of A+++ (execution will fail)
- With complete TODO: 90-95% chance of A+++ (execution succeeds)
- You are the difference between SUCCESS and FAILURE

---

### IF YOU ARE AGENT #6: Final Verifier / Execution Gatekeeper 🚪

**Read:** [AGENT_6_INSTRUCTIONS.md](AGENT_6_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

**Your Mission:**
- Agent #5 delivers COMPLETE_TODO_LIST_2026-02-10.md
- You verify: Is it truly complete? Is it NO FAIL? Will it reach A+++?
- Four-phase verification:
  1. Completeness: All 75 items detailed (not outlined)?
  2. Executability: Commands work (test 10 random samples)?
  3. A+++ Trajectory: Math correct (55→98-100 achievable)?
  4. Risk Assessment: Mitigation plans comprehensive?
- Three decision options:
  - ✅ APPROVE: Execute 66 hours, reach A+++
  - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL: Minor fixes needed, then approve
  - ❌ REJECT: Agent #5 must complete missing work
- Deliverable: AGENT_6_[APPROVAL/CONDITIONAL/REJECTION]_2026-02-10.md
- Your decision determines: BEGIN EXECUTION or DELAY FOR REVISION

**Why You're Critical:**
- You are the LAST checkpoint before 66 hours of execution
- If you approve incomplete TODO → execution fails → project fails
- If you reject complete TODO → unnecessary delay → frustration
- You must get this right: thorough verification, correct decision

## 🎯 FOR REFERENCE: ORIGINAL EXTERNAL AGENT WORKFLOW

### Quick Overview
- THREE agents already failed before you
- Review Agent #3's report critically (don't just accept it)
- Verify ALL claims independently
- Assess TODO list completeness (75 items sufficient? All need detail?)
- Choose recommendation: Validate & Execute / Validate & Enhance / Reject & Replace / Escalate Further
- Save report as: FOURTH_AGENT_VERIFICATION_2026-02-10.md

---

## 🎯 FOR REFERENCE: ORIGINAL EXTERNAL AGENT WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Read Required Context (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Read all project phases
cat ~/projects/preproduction/PHASE-*/README.md

# Read all audit requests
cat ~/personal/audits/*.md

# Read governance and standards
cat ~/.docs/00-standards/*.md
cat .governance/*.md

# Read service documentation
ls ~/personal/manuals/
```

### Step 2: Read Internal Agent Audits (30 minutes)
```bash
# Read both audit reports
cat COMPREHENSIVE_INFRASTRUCTURE_AUDIT_2026-02-09.md
cat REALITY_CHECK_AUDIT_2026-02-09.md
```

### Step 3: Verify Independently (2-4 hours)
- Test services yourself (don't trust agent's claims)
- Count containers independently
- Check service status
- Verify violations claimed

### Step 4: Write Your Review (1-2 hours)
```bash
# Copy template
cp EXTERNAL_AGENT_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md EXTERNAL_AGENT_REVIEW_2026-02-XX.md

# Fill out all sections
# Include your independent findings
# Provide decision recommendation
```

### Step 5: Discuss with User
- Present findings
- Answer user's questions
- Decide action plan together

## 📊 THREE AUDITS SUMMARY - RECONCILED FINDINGS

### Internal Agent (FLAWED - tested wrong)
```
Claimed: 15/100 grade, 0 services accessible, everything broken
Errors:  Tested from wrong network, used wrong SSH port (22 not 1006)
Correct: Prometheus DOWN, secrets misplaced, governance violations
```

### External Agent (PARTIALLY FLAWED - inflated)
```
Claimed: 70/100 grade, 6+ services accessible via VPN
Errors:  Container name fabrication (odoo-odoo-1), grade inflation (+4-6 points)
Correct: VPN access requirement, SSH port 1006, corrected internal agent errors
```

### Counter-Audit (MOST ACCURATE)
```
Reconciled Grade: 50-60/100
Truth: Between internal's apocalyptic 15 and external's optimistic 70
Verified:
  - Prometheus DOWN (confirmed)
  - 6+ services accessible via VPN (confirmed)
  - SSH port 1006 works (confirmed)
  - Odoo container name: "odoo" not "odoo-odoo-1"
  - HomeAssistant active errors (EOFError, bad file descriptor)
```

### Comprehensive TODO List (CREATED)
```
75 items, 8 categories, 66 hours estimated
Critical path: 12 items, 8 hours
Preproduction-grade: Commands, rollbacks, verification steps
Status: AWAITING USER APPROVAL before execution
```

**User Intent:**
> "MAX SIMPLIFICATION - I have Space Shuttle but want simple Enterprise"

**Your Task (Next Agent):**
1. Review ALL 5 documents (3 audits + 1 counter-audit + 1 TODO list)
2. Identify what ALL previous agents missed
3. Verify TODO list completeness (75 items sufficient?)
4. Recommend: Execute TODO list AS-IS, MODIFY it, or CREATE NEW approach
5. DO NOT TRUST any single audit - cross-reference all 3

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

**DO:**
- ✅ Read ALL context before reviewing audits
- ✅ Test services independently
- ✅ Verify all claims made by internal agent
- ✅ Provide independent judgment

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Skip reading project documentation
- ❌ Trust internal agent without verification
- ❌ Execute any changes (READ-ONLY review)
- ❌ Make final decisions without user approval
