# HANDOVER TO AGENT #6

## ⚠️ MANDATORY REQUIREMENT - LOG VERIFICATION

**USER REQUIREMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
> "I want that every next agent CHECK LOG!!!! ALLL LOGSSSSS!!!!!! Native services, docker, possible, impossible, lady, master... ALL LOGS!!!!!!!!! MUST BE CHECKED!!!! Without that TASK IS NOT COMPLETED!!!"

**YOU MUST VERIFY Agent #5 checked ALL logs:**
- ✅ Does Agent #5's TODO list reference actual log errors?
- ✅ Does each TODO item have log evidence section?
- ✅ Did Agent #5 check Master + Lady native logs?
- ✅ Did Agent #5 check all 61 container logs?
- ✅ Are error patterns documented with actual log output?

**IF Agent #5 didn't check logs → AUTOMATIC REJECTION → They must check logs and resubmit**

---

**Your Mission:** VERIFY Agent #5's complete TODO list. APPROVE or REJECT for execution.

**Read First:** `/home/qui3tly/projects/preproduction/handover/AGENT_6_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**All Documents Attached:** `/home/qui3tly/projects/preproduction/handover/` (including Agent #5's COMPLETE_TODO_LIST_2026-02-10.md)

**Verification Checklist:**
1. **LOG EVIDENCE:** Every TODO item has actual log output? (MANDATORY)
2. Completeness: All 75/90/120 items detailed? (not outlined)
3. Executability: Commands work? (test 10 random samples)
4. A+++ Trajectory: Math correct? (59/100 → 98-100/100 achievable)
5. Risk Assessment: Mitigation plans comprehensive?

**Decision Options:**
- ✅ APPROVE: Execute 66 hours toward A+++
- ⚠️ CONDITIONAL: Minor fixes needed
- ❌ REJECT: Agent #5 must complete missing work

**Your Deliverable:** `AGENT_6_[APPROVAL/CONDITIONAL/REJECTION]_2026-02-10.md`

**Context:** You are the LAST checkpoint before 66 hours of execution. If you approve incomplete TODO → project fails. If you reject complete TODO → unnecessary delay. GET THIS RIGHT.

**This is the gatekeeper role. Thorough verification. Correct decision.**

**GO.**
